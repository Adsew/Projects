## Graphics Final Project

As a two person group project with Matthew Warner, we created a our own custom graphics section on top of our custom C++ engine.

Using open GL, we created a system that could read and utilize multiple custom shaders for rendering 3D objects in our game world. This also included creating the ability to read in custom models created in Blender.

Feel free to load up the project and see how we did it! The game itself is a hidden object game, where you traverse a showcase area to find 5 hidden tauruses.

If you have any trouble compiling the project, ensure the settings are fora 32-bit operating system to match with the openGL library version.
