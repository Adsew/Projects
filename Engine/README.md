## C++ Engine

This is a C++ engine I have written myself. It uses an RTTI system to identify new classes and is modeled after Unity's hierarchy system. The engine uses game objects, components, scenes, and prefabs. There is basic UI components and functionality as well.

Under the hood, the engine utilizes SFML for graphics support.

A self made version of bomberman is used to showcase the engine.

 * 'WASD' controls movement and 'Space' drops a bomb.
 * There are three levels to play.
 * Kill all the enemies before they kill you!
