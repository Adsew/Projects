## Project U.M.B.R.E.L.A.

Project UMBRELA is a 2.5D platformer with some action combat. The game features a young girl names Ella who is ported to a space station with nothing but a high tech umbrella. The umbrella is both her only tool and weapon throughout the game.

This current version is the gold master vertical slice. Controller is required.

The game was developed in a small studio of six, including myself, as the capstone project for our post-graduate programs.

Feel free to experience all the hard work we have done in a four month period!

I also maintained the active twitter account, @SunShadeStudios, throughout development, where we posted progress, images, and suggestions.
