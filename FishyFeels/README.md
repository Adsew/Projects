## Fishy Feels
['Unity Project']

Help this little cat reach the bucket of tastey fish throughout the map by creating platforms to jump to!

As part of Sheridan College's winter sprint week 2018, students were tasked to create a game for the Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital ['https://www.hollandbloorview.ca/']. I worked mainly on the cat's AI in this project.

The game was designed for a 4:3 aspect ratio and a special 10x10 grid pressure floor, but you can test it on your PC with mouse controls! The game was to be designed in a way that any child could play and enjoy the experience, regardless of their abilities.

# Controls

 * Click an area above the grass to create a platform.
 * The cat will automatically jump to any platform created, preferring those closer to the fish.
 * At max length, a bird will drop a fish on the platform.
 * Click on the center of the platform to remove it.
